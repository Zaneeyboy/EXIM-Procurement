### Awaiting Another Invoice or Ending the Process

At this stage of the process, the Procurement Officer can decide the next steps for the direction of the process itself. The form available at this point has read-only access to all of the information
available in the process at this point and the Procurement Officer can review the information before making one of two decisions:

1. Await Another Invoice - If this option is selected, the Procurement Officer directs the process to the beginning of the Invoicing component of the process, where invoice information would once again have to be populated and the various steps for reconciliation and variance analysis would again have to occur.
2. Close Purchase Order Process - If this option is selected, it means one of two things:

   - The Vendor is unable to fully invoice all of the items that were ordered in the Purchase Order, and therefore the process must be closed.
   - The Vendor has invoiced and delivered all of that which was ordered in the Purchase Order and the process can finally come to a close.

     At this stage, if the process is closed, then all updates to the database will be allowed to complete in the background, and a full report of this Purchase Order process will now be available in Dashboards and Report tools. Thus, the Purchase Order Process will be marked closed and terminated at this point.
