### Rejecting the Invoice

At any stage of the Invoicing component of this process, once a user selects the option to _Reject the Invoice_, control of the process is passed to the Procurement Officer.
At this point, the Procurement Officer wil review all of the information submitted in the process up to this point and will begin the process of contacting the Vendor on the issues encountered.
**Note:** All information at this point in the process is in read-only format.

At this stage, there are two options that will be presented to the Procurement Officer. The Procurement Officer may choose to:

1. Manually Notify the Vendor of the Rejected Invoice - Selecting this option assumes that the Procurement Officer will contact the Vendor through whatever means may be most convenient to resolve the issue.
2. Email the Vendor about the Rejected Invoice - Selecting this option navigates the procurement officer to a new task form where, in addition to all of the read-only fields seen previously, they will now have the ability to enter information to create an email, which will be automatically sent to the Vendor once the form is submitted. This email will send the Purchase Order Document along with any message the Procurement Officer may wish to include.

Once the form is submitted, control of the process is passed again to the Procurement Officer and awaits their decision to proceed or close the process.
