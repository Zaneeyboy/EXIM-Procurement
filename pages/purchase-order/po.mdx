| Purchase Order Comments  | Log of comments made by individuals regarding what needs to be changed in the Purchase Order's details before it can be approved and sent to the selected Vendor | No        |

Once all mandatory fields have been populated, the information on the form has been reviewed and any changes that need to be addressed as mentioned in the _Purchase Order Comments_ log field have been made, the
Procurement Officer can then select _Submit for Approval_. This will pass control of the process on to a Higher-Level Manager or Procurement Officer for their approval before the Purchase Order document is generated.
Depending on the cost of the Purchase Order, this part of the process can be sent to one of three levels of Approvers:

1. With a total cost of less than **\$10,000.00**, the Purchase Order will be passed on to a Higher-Level Procurement Officer for approval.
2. With a total cost between **\$10,000.00** and **\$15,000.00** , the Purchase Order will be passed on to a Manager for approval.
3. With a total cost greater than **\$15,000.00** , the Purchase Order will be passed on to the Higher-Level Managers (C-Rank Managers) for approval.

At each of the approval stages listed above, the approver can reject the Purchase Order with comments for changes to be made before it proceeds forward for approval once again. However, if the Purchase Order's details
have been approved, the _Purchase Order Document_ is generated which can then be sent to the selected vendor.

#### Sending the Purchase Order To Vendors

When the Purchase Order document is generated, the Procurement Officer at this stage has two options:

1. _Email Purchase Order_ - If this option is selected, the user is navigated to a task form with several noteworthy fields. The fields must be populated before an email containing the _Purchase Order Document_ as an attachment can be sent out to the selectd Vendor.

| Field         | Description                                                                                                           | Mandatory |

| Email Subject | Subject of the email that will be sent to the selected Vendor with the _Purchase Order Document_                      | Yes       |
| Email CC      | CC of email that will be sent to selected vendor                                                                      | Yes       |
| Email Body    | This s the message that will be sent to the selected Vendor along with the _Purchase Order Document_ as an attachment | Yes       |

2. _Manually Submit Purchase Order_ - If this option is selected, it is assumed that the _Purchase Order Document_ will be downloaded, printed and given to the Vendor manually

Once an option is selected, the process proceeds to _Invoicing_ where it now awaits invoices from the selected vendor along with the receipt of goods.
