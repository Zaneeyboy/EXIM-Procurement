# Export Import Bank of Trinidad and Tobago

## Procurement Process Documentation

This application functions to document the flow, functionality and process of the Export Import Bank of Trinidad and Tobago's newly created **Procurement Process**. The Procurement Process is segmented into three(3) main parts, consisting of :

1. The Vendor Process
2. The Purchase Requisition Process
3. The Purchase Order process

Each of these processes is thoroughly documented from start to finish. A user may navigate to any page by simply clicking the component of interest in the process folder. After which, the full documentation
regarding that component of the process will be displayed on screen.

There is also a search tool which uses Algolia Search Indexing to retrieve component(file) names similar to and matching that of what is entered into the search bar.

A small icon is also available to the top right of the screen, which would enable the user to toggle bewteen Light and Dark modes, depending upon their preference.

There are various hyperlinks available to link the interested User to the Github repository where all of this documentation is stored.

Should any issues be encountered while using this application, please reach out to the **800-Tech Limited** team for further assistance.
