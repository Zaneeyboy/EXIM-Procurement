## Update Vendor Details Option (Selected)

When this operation is selected, the user will be navigated to a task form with a single _Vendor_ field.
This field is a dropdown menu from which, the user must select a vendor from the listing of available vendors.

When a vendor is selected and the form is submitted, all information pertaining to the selected vendor is retrieved from the database and populated into fields.
The user then has the ability to make changes to any of the fields listed, including the _Vendor Categories Table_.

When all updates are made and submitted in the form, all relevant changes and updates to the fields will be made to the corresponding database records.
