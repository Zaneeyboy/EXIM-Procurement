## View Vendor Details Option (Selected)

When this operation is selected, the user will be navigated to a task form with a single _Vendor_ field.
This field is a dropdown menu from which, the user must select a vendor from the listing of available vendors to proceed.

When a vendor is selected and the form is submitted, all information pertaining to the selected vendor is retrieved from the
database and populated into fields for viewing purposes only.
No data on this page can be changed and likewise, no updates can be pushed to the database and corresponding vendor records.

Then the user has the option to select another vendor to view their corresponding data, or to end the process at this point.

A listing of all relevant fields for this operation are given below:
