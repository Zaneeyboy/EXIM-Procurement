## Manager review

### Users

All approved managers with access to E-Flow should have access to this part of the process.

When the requester submits the purchase requisition, complete with all details regarding the purchase requisition, the process is passed on to a Manager for approval.
At this stage, all details concerning the purchase requisition are available but in read only format.
The Manager must review these details and make comments in the comments log for other users to see later on in the process.

#### Form Options

- Reject to Requester : If there is an issue with the data in the purchase requisition, the manager can make note of the issue in the comments
  and send the process back to the requester, where they can review the comments and make the necessary changes before submitting the form once more for _Manager Review_.
- Approve : Once a manager approves, the process is passed on to Finance for review. The manager must still comment on the process before it can be approved for Finance to review.
- Cancel : This will end the process at this point.
