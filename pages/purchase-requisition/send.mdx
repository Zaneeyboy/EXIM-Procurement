## Sending a Request for Quotation

### Users

All approved Procurement Officers with access to E-Flow should have access to this part of the process.

### Sending a request for quotation

At this stage, the Procurement Officer has generated the request for quotation document.

This document is available for download and can be sent to the selected vendors in the _RFQ Vendor Table_
automatically if the _Email RFQ To Vendors_ option is selected. In this case, the user will be navigated to a form where they will have to populate three fields (Email CC, Email Subject and Email Message).
These fields will be used as placeholders in the email which will be sent to the selected vendors. The email address field, which is not visible to the user, is pulled from the database and used to send the email to each applicable vendor in the table.

The User can also opt to manually submit the RFQ Document to the applicable vendors, in which case, they would select the form option _Manually Send RFQ_.

**Note:**
Both options listed above take the vendor data as well as the item data and make relevant entries into the database, which will be retrieved for use later on in the process.
Therefore, it is important that all data be entered accordingly so that the system can operate as intended throughout the process.

#### Form Options

- Send another RFQ: The process will navigate to the start of the creation of a request for quotation, where the user can again commence with creating a request for quotation to be sent out to applicable vendors.
- END RFQ Process: The process terminates at this point.
