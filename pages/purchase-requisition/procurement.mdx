## Procurement Review

### Users

All approved Procurement Officers with access to E-Flow should have access to this part of the process.

When the Finance Officer approves the purchase requisition, the process is passed on to the office of procurement. At this stage, all data regarding the purchase requisition
is available in read only format. The Procurement Officer must review all the data and if necessary, reject the purchase requisition to the appropriate party with comments so that the
necessary changes can be made, before the process is approved.

#### Form Options

- Prepare RFQ : The Procurement Officer at this point sends the process forward, one all the information on the purchase requisitionis acceptable, so that the request for quotation document(s) can be prepared and sent to vendors.
- Reject To Finance : The process is passed back to Finance with comments indicating what needs to be changed before the purchase requisition can be approved.
- Reject to Requester : The process is passed back to the Requester with comments indicating what needs to be changed before the purchase requisition can be approved.
- Cancel : This will end the process at this point.
