## Finance Review

### Users

All approved Finance Officers with access to E-Flow should have access to this part of the process.

When the Manager approves the purchase requisition, complete with comments (log of changes/notes), the process is passed on to Finance for review and approval.
At this stage, all details concerning the purchase requisition are available, but only in read only format.

The Finance Officer must review these details and make comments in the comments log for other users to see later on in the process.
They must also select an account from the list of accounts that will be used to deduct funds from to pay for the items selected and sent in a purchase order later in the process.

#### Form Options

- Approve : Once Finance approves the form, the process is passed on to the office of procurement for review.
- Reject To Manager : The process is passed back to the Manager with comments indicating what needs to be changed before the purchase requisition can be approved.
- Cancel : This will end the process at this point.
